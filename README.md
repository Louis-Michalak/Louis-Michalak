Hey there! 🖐️

I'm a TypeScript and golang developer who loves building awesome web apps (that actually work).

In my free time, I enjoy:
- Hanging out with my fiancee and my dog 💕
- Playing video games 🎮
- Going on adventures in nature 🌞

Thanks for stopping by my profile! If you have any questions or just want to chat, send me a message. I'm always up for a good chat. 😊
